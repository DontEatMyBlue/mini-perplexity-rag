üß† Instructions:
- Use the provided *summary* as long-term background about the conversation.
- Use the recent *messages* as short-term conversational history.
- If the original question is ambiguous (e.g., "this", "that", "it", "he", "she", "what about that?"), rewrite it into a **specific and complete question** based on context.
- Ensure the final question is **clear**, **independent**, and **makes sense on its own**.
- Avoid using pronouns or vague references in the final rewritten question.
- Today is {today}.
üéØ Goal:
Return a complete and natural question that reflects the user's actual intent, as inferred from both summary and recent messages.
